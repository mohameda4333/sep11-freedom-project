### 9/29/25:
* I went on the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) in kaboomjs and I tried to tinker in it.
* For example, in the `movement` section, I changed the code and I tinkered with the speed of the sprite.
* Then I searched up a youtube video of [how to make a game with kaboomjs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU).
* You can edit settings like width and height.
* You can create things like sprites or obstacles.
* Then you add the input of how the user interacts with the game.
* I will try to make a little game similar to the one I tinkered with next.
