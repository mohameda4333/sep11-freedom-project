## Project: Game to test gun aim on target

### 9/29/25:
* I went on the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) in kaboomjs and I tried to tinker in it.
* For example, in the `movement` section, I changed the code and I tinkered with the speed of the sprite.
* Then I searched up a youtube video of [how to make a game with kaboomjs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU).
* You can edit settings like width and height.
* You can create things like sprites or obstacles.
* Then you add the input of how the user interacts with the game.
* I will try to make a little game similar to the one I tinkered with next.

### 11/2/25:
* I tinkered with my tool through jsbin. I went to the "setup" page on jsbin: (https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup). Then I copy and pasted the code into jsbin. The result was a gray and white squared background with the text: "Hello". Then I tried adding a sprite but it gave me an error because I put the code: "addsprite.png". I realized I had to have an image with that title and add it to the code. Then it would show a green sprite centered at (120, 80).
* I also went on the website itself and did some research:
* I learned that downloading the code makes it easier to work with kaboom.js.
* It reminded me of what I did in computer science because I can make sprites and give them an order. I can also place it somewhere specific based on the coordinates I put in the code.
