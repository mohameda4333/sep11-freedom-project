### Content
In this freedom project, I am using [kaboomjs](kaboomjs.com) to make a mini shooter game to aim at a target. I want to make the user shoot by pressing the mouse. This tool is similar to what I learned in computer science as it allows me to make a sprite that I can control. Instead of a sprite, I want to make a little toy gun that shoots at command with targets all around the map.
