## Content
In this freedom project, I am using [kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/) to make a mini shooter game to aim at a target. I want to make the user shoot by pressing the mouse. This tool is similar to what I learned in computer science as it allows me to make a sprite that I can control. Instead of a sprite, I want to make a little toy gun that shoots at command with targets all around the map. This connects to computer science as I have to learn how to make and animate sprites, respond to the users input, using what I learned in functions to make a game loop. Instead of creating a human sprite, I want to create a little toy gun sprite that moves along with the users cursor. I also plan to make a scoring system that increases depending on the users accuracy. I tinkered with my tool through jsbin. I went to the [setup](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) page on the kaboomjs website. Then I copy and pasted the code into jsbin. The result was a gray and white squared background with the text: "Hello". Then I tried adding a sprite but it gave me an error because I put the code: `addsprite.png`. I realized I had to have an image with that title and add it to the code. Then it would show a green sprite centered at (120, 80). I learned that to import images, tinkering with my tool in my IDE is the best option because it has my saved work and it is a lot easier to import images.
## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently in step two of the Engineering Design Process which is to research the problem. I am researching about how to use kaboom so that I can learn more about how to use this tool. I tinkered with beginner codes located on the website and edited it in [JSbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output).
## Skills
Some skills I learned while researching about my tool is `How to learn` and `Organization`.
### How to Learn
This skill was very useful because I learned how to understand the code and information located in the [setup](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) page. In the beginning, it was confusing to understand the code and how to install it on my monitor. However, I copied and pasted the starter code in jsbin and a gray and white map popped up. The kaboomjs website has a lot of links and information so I carefully understood the introduction and the starter code. Then I went into the playground to test what I learned. 
### Organization
Organization is a very essential skill that helped me throughout my research. It taught me how to organize my files in my IDE and make a file for my tool so that it makes it easier for me to import images and save my work. Organization is a very essential skill even outside of my tool because it is very important to organize my work from my classes so that I can free up some time to tinker with my tool. I need to organize my daily work excluding school work to be able to keep up with every class.
## Next steps
For my next step, I plan to brainstorm possible solutions as step 3 of the Engineering Design Process. I plan to understand more about my tool and how to use it with javascript. I also want to organize my time outside of school so that I can have more time to tinker with my tool.
