## Content
In this freedom project, I am using [kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/) to make a mini shooter game to aim at a target. I want to make the user shoot by pressing the mouse. This tool is similar to what I learned in computer science as it allows me to make a sprite that I can control. Instead of a sprite, I want to make a little toy gun that shoots at command with targets all around the map.
## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently in step two of the Engineering Design Process which is to research the problem. I am researching about how to use kaboom so that I can learn more about how to use this tool. I tinkered with beginner codes located on the website and edited it in [JSbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output).
## Skills
Some skills I learned while researching about my tool is `How to learn` and `Organization`.
### How to Learn
This skill was very useful because I learned how to understand the code and information located in the [setup](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) page. In the beginning, it was confusing to understand the code and how to install it on my monitor. However, I copied and pasted the starter code in jsbin and a gray and white map popped up.
### Organization
Organization is a very essential skill that helped me throughout my research. It taught me how to organize my files in my IDE and make a file for my tool so that it makes it easier for me to import images and save my work.
